  <h1>About OpenBook</h1>

  <div class="about-container">
    <p><strong>OpenBook</strong> is a chill, community-powered digital library curated and maintained by <strong>Dwip</strong> 💻📚</p>

    <p>This project started as a 9th-grade idea — to build a site where anyone could download free books. Now, it's something real: a centralized hub to access some of the best free PDFs on the internet.</p>

    <p>📖 The idea hit me during an educational tour to a nearby slum area. I saw kids who had dreams but no resources — no books, no guidance. That moment stuck with me. So I created OpenBook to make knowledge more accessible — for them, and for anyone who needs it.</p>

    <p>⚠️ <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> OpenBook does <u>not</u> host pirated content. All files are either in the public domain, educational, or freely available online. The goal is to help people learn, grow, and explore knowledge — without ads, logins, or shady popups 💀.</p>

    <p>🚀 Built with love using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hosted on Netlify. Updated manually because I like pain 😎</p>
